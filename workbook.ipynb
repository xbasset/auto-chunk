    "    \"question\": \"What is the key distinction between a classical network packet and a qubit?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"In contrast, entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more qubits exist in a physically distributed state. Operations on one of the qubits change the mutual state of the pair. Since the owner of a particular qubit cannot just read out its state, it must coordinate all its actions with the owner of the pair's other qubit.\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"How is error correction different in quantum networks versus classical networks?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"Therefore, we cannot use the same methods known from classical computing for the purposes of error detection and correction. Nevertheless, quantum error detection and correction schemes exist that take this problem into account, and how a network chooses to manage errors will have an impact on its architecture.\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"What are the key differences between first, second, and third generation quantum networks?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"Generations are defined by the directions of classical signalling required in their distributed protocols for loss tolerance and error tolerance. Classical signalling carries the classical bits, incurring round-trip delays... The three \\\"generations\\\" summarised: 1) First-generation quantum networks use heralding for loss tolerance and entanglement distillation for error tolerance. 2) Second-generation quantum networks improve upon the first generation with QEC codes for error tolerance (but not loss tolerance). 3) Third-generation quantum networks directly transmit QEC-encoded qubits to adjacent nodes.\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"Why can't qubits be amplified like classical signals?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary, unknown quantum state. Therefore, it is also impossible to use the same mechanisms that worked for classical networks for signal amplification, retransmission, and so on, as they all rely on the ability to copy the underlying data.\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"What are the two meanings of \\\"qubit\\\"?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"In the first meaning, \\\"qubit\\\" refers to a physical quantum system whose quantum state can be expressed as a superposition of two basis states, which we often label |0⟩ and |1⟩. Here, \\\"qubit\\\" refers to a physical implementation akin to what a flip-flop, switch, voltage, or current would be for a classical bit. In the second meaning, \\\"qubit\\\" refers to the abstract quantum state of a quantum system with such two basis states. In this case, the meaning of \\\"qubit\\\" is akin to the logical value of a bit, from classical computing, i.e., \\\"logical 0\\\" or \\\"logical 1\\\".\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"How do quantum repeaters extend entanglement over long distances?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"The solution is entanglement swapping. A Bell pair between any two nodes in the network can be constructed by combining the pairs generated along each individual link on a path between the two end-points. Each node along the path can consume the two pairs on the two links to which it is connected, in order to produce a new entangled pair between the two remote ends. This process is known as entanglement swapping.\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"What classical communication is necessary in a quantum network?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"Classical communication is a crucial building block of any quantum network. All nodes in a quantum network are assumed to have classical connectivity with each other (within typical administrative domain limits).\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"What are the key elements of a quantum network architecture?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"We have identified quantum repeaters as the core building block of a quantum network. However, a quantum repeater will have to do more than just entanglement swapping in a functional quantum network. Its key responsibilities will include the following: 1) Creating link-local entanglement between neighbouring nodes. 2) Extending entanglement from link-local pairs to long-range pairs through entanglement swapping. 3) Performing distillation to manage the fidelity of the produced pairs. 4) Participating in the management of the network (routing, etc.).\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"What are the key differences between the control and data planes in quantum versus classical networks?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"In quantum networks, control plane traffic (routing and signalling messages) is exchanged over a classical channel, whereas data plane traffic (the actual Bell pair qubits) is exchanged over a separate quantum channel.\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"question\": \"What are the key challenges in monitoring a quantum network?\",\n",
    "    \"answer\": \"The fundamental unit of quantum information, the qubit, cannot be actively monitored, as any readout irreversibly destroys its contents. One of the implications of this fact is that measuring an individual pair's fidelity is impossible. Fidelity is meaningful only as a statistical quantity that requires constant monitoring of generated Bell pairs, achieved by sacrificing some Bell pairs for use in tomography or other methods.\"\n",
